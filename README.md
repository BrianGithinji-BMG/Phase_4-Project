## Introduction
In todayâ€™s highly competitive streaming landscape, personalized movie recommendations play a crucial role in user engagement and retention. Hulu, which holds 11% of the market share in the streaming industry, is looking to upgrade its current movie recommendation algorithm. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that provides users with the top 5 movie recommendations based on their previous ratings of other movies.

Our audience for this project is the Hulu Technology Team, headed by the CTO of Hulu.This project will explore an enhanced algorithm to improve the quality of recommendations for Hulu subscribers.

## Data Understanding
The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Grouplens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/), utilizing information from IMDb and TMDb. The data contains over 100,000 movie ratings provided by 610 different users for about 9,700 movies, collected over a time span from 1996 to 2018. Each user has reviewed at least 20 different movies.

While the full dataset consists of approximately 1.9 million ratings, this project focuses on a subset of 100,000 ratings due to time constraints.

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- User ID: A unique identifier for each user.
- Movie ID: A unique identifier for each movie.
- Ratings: A score from 0.5 to 5.0 given by a user for a movie.
- Timestamp: The time when the rating was provided.
- Movie Metadata: Information about the movies, such as title and genres.
This data is crucial for building a collaborative filtering model that can predict which movies a user is likely to rate highly based on the behavior of similar users.
